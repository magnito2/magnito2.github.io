            <p>I am <span>Magnus Otwani</span>, a.k.a <a href="http://www.github.com/magnito2">magnito</a>,  am a guy filled with curosity, determination, coupled with some
            serious interest in tech which has made me pretty knowledgeable in lots of tech stuff, from coding,
            to machine learning, to cryptocurrencies to 3D printing. All these coupled with a degree in Civil Engineering
            makes me hard to understand by many people, who prefer to keep their lives simple and stress free. But am cool. Guess I was just born differently, am left handed
            for instance!</p>
            <p>I created this page to do a periodic memory dump whenever I feel a new thing is bugging me up, or when I
            think some great idea needs more attention than its recieving, or when I have a crush on a new tech ;)</p>
